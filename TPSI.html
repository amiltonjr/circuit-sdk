reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
